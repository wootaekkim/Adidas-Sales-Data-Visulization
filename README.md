The Main goal of this project was creating data visualization answering following questions using Adidas Sales data:
- How are Sales Distributed Geographically? Are there regions with Significant growth or decline
- Are there any regional differences in product preferences.
- Which Adidas products or product categories are the top sellers?
- Are there any underperforming products that we need to address?
- How does 2021 revenue compare to the same period last year?
- Are there any noticeable trend or patterns in sales data?

### Data Quality/Manipulation
I primarily employed Microsoft Excel for data manipulation, and fortunately, the overall data quality was quite high, requiring minimal preprocessing. Nonetheless, there were a few data adjustments needed. Some numerical values were initially set as non-numeric, so I had to convert them from a general format to a numeric one.

Additionally, I performed data preprocessing by splitting a particular column. This column contained product descriptions in a format like "Women's Street FootWear." To enhance the data's structure and usability, I separated this column into two distinct ones: "Gender" and "Product Category."

### Data visualization
For data visualization, I created an interactive dashboard using Tableau, comprising four main sections.

#### Trend of Sales and Operating Sales
- This section primarily highlights the variance in total sales and operating profit between 2020 and 2022.
- Another key focus of this section is to illustrate the quarterly and monthly trends in sales and operating profit.

#### Product Category and unit sold
- This section primarily presents the unit sales for each product category.
- Filters for year, state, and city have been applied to enable the audience to delve deeper into each specific year and region.
- Notably, a key observation here is that "Street Footwear" had the highest sales among men, while "Apparel" was the top-selling category among women.

#### Total Sales, Operating Profit by Various factors
- This section primarily displays Total Sales and Operating Profit categorized by product category, retailers, sales method, and regions.
- To facilitate deeper exploration, a range of interactive filters has been implemented for the audience.
- Further information about these action filters can be found on the dashboard for a more detailed explanation of their functionality.
